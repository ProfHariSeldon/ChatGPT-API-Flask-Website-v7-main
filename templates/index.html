    {% if graph %}
        <h2>Selected Graph:</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename=graph) }}" alt="Selected Graph">
    {% endif %}
    
    <h2>How I wrote the website:</h2>
    
    <p>To chat with ChatGPT 4 I copied python code from main.py and HTML code from chat3.5.html from <a href="https://github.com/redemptionwxy/ChatGPT-API-Flask-Website">https://github.com/redemptionwxy/ChatGPT-API-Flask-Website</a> then asked ChatGPT for python code to do the job of the script.js.</p>
    
    <ul>In main.py, 8 lines of code is importing the modules ChatGPT forgot to add.  It took me a while to figure out how to add the ChatGPT 4 api_key and ChatGPT Transcriptome Classifier Custom GPT assistantId. Then there are 30 lines of code I copied from the ChatGPT documentation <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview?context=with-streaming">https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview?context=with-streaming</a> to ask questions in the terminal.  Then there are 18 lines of code copied from <a href="https://github.com/redemptionwxy/ChatGPT-API-Flask-Website">https://github.com/redemptionwxy/ChatGPT-API-Flask-Website</a> to create the ChatGPT 4 text box one can ask any question of then push the submit button.  Then there are 54 lines of code I got from ChatGPT that I improved.  Then there is one line of code to return render_template('index.html', prompt=prompt, response=response, graph=graph) which is to send the variables prompt, response, and graph to index.html, to make the webpage dynamic, that I got from ChatGPT but added graph=graph.  Then there is two lines of code to run the app and host it on port 5000.</ul>
    
    <ul>In index.html, 52 lines of code is my radio buttons I wrote myself after looking up how to make radio buttons in general and 18 lines of code with the if and endif I wrote myself after looking up how to do ifs in HTML.  6 lines of code in the index.html is the text box you can type your questions into and that was copied from <a href="https://github.com/redemptionwxy/ChatGPT-API-Flask-Website">https://github.com/redemptionwxy/ChatGPT-API-Flask-Website</a>.</ul>
    
    <p>To dynamically generate the graphs, I had a foundation of code without importing modules from my asking for help from ChatGPT.  Since ChatGPT did not import the packages I had to do that.  Then I created ./static/chromosmoes.py to generate the graphs in 716 lines of code I modified from ChatGPT.  Then I improved that code to be much shorter (18 lines of code in main.py) and put it in main.py and no longer use ./static/chromosmoes.py.  Then I looked up how to add radio buttons to select which graph you want to dynamically generate.</p>
    
    <p>I also got the terminal (while building the website) to chat with my Transcriptome Classifier custom ChatGPT so that one could ask questions of ChatGPT about the files I use to create the graphs.  That is what content = "How many circRNAs are in hsa_hg38_circRNA.bed?" does.  The answer the terminal gives is 183718 circRNAs and is correct.  However, the how to do that in the terminal documentation <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview?context=with-streaming">https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview?context=with-streaming</a> does not explain how to do that in a website and thread = client.beta.threads.create() and message = client.beta.threads.messages.create() seem to not have the ability to be in a website only a terminal.  I asked for help from the ChatGPT website and they said they needed help from a collegue and they would get back to me.  That is all of the code before @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST']) in main.py.</p>
